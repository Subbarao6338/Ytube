    // August 2026.

    // **A channel page describes itself, and this section is written to let it.**
    // The first browse returns the tab list with each tab's own `params`, every
    // sort order with its own continuation token, and every next page as
    // another token. So there is exactly one hardcoded browse parameter in here
    // (CHANNEL_VIDEOS_TAB_PARAMS, kept only as the fallback for a response whose
    // tab list failed to parse), and no fixed set of tabs.
    //
    // That matters beyond tidiness. Tab sets genuinely differ per channel:
    // a musician has "Releases" where a teacher has "Courses" and a big tech
    // channel has "Podcasts" and "Store". Hardcoding the six tabs YouTube shows
    // one channel would have meant drawing empty tabs on channels that lack
    // them and hiding real ones on channels that have more - and both failures
    // are silent, which is the worst kind.
    //
    // Everything here works signed out, which is the whole point: deciding
    // whether a creator is worth following is exactly the thing a signed-out
    // user does most.
